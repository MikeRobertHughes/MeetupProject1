# Starter Kit based on the angular-seed app

### Prerequisites

Clone the repo. 
Install node.js and npm. 

Everything is already set up for you. Just run:

```
npm install
```

This will run bower, which will add the bower-components and the node_modules. Once that's done, install a node server. 

```
npm install -g serve
cd starterkit/app
serve
```
 
There are more files in there for testing, but we'll get into that after we cover the basics.
