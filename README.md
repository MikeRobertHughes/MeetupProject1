# Starter Kit 

This is based on the angular-seed app, with some variations: it's using gulp to watch & compile the bootstrap files, contains no grunt, and is actually pretty stripped-down, all things considered.

### Prerequisites

Install node.js and npm. 

Clone the repo. 

### Getting Started

Everything is already set up for you. Just run:

```
npm install
```

This will kick off bower and get all the dependencies set up. Once that's done, install a node server. 

```
npm install -g serve
cd starterkit/app
serve
```

### More coming...
 
There are more files in there for testing, but we'll get into that after we cover the basics.
